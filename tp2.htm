			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>ijuxda wrote:</cite>Being a free software project maintainer demands a certain level of transparency, accountability and respect. All the more so when the project provides binary packages and accepts donations to fund its operations.</div></blockquote><br />To answer the implicit question -- users know what goes into the binaries because people review the code; because it's actually the distro liasons who do the *nix builds, and because dozens and dozens of users have sniffed Transmission's packets with wireshark and LS. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> <br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>ijuxda wrote:</cite>As should be made clear to everyone following this situation, by now the central issue is not whether or how proxy support should be implemented in the <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">transmission</b> codebase, but the fundamental lack of professionalism and undeserved contempt that discussions regarding this feature have brought to light.<br /><br />In particular it is important to keep in mind the following questions when judging the arguments and exchanges taking place in this thread, <a href="https://forum.transmissionbt.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=10864" class="postlink">this one</a>, and in these trac tickets <a href="https://trac.transmissionbt.com/ticket/3688" class="postlink">#3688</a> <a href="https://trac.transmissionbt.com/ticket/3817" class="postlink">#3817</a>:<br /><br />1. Why was the removal of the proxy feature not included in the <a href="https://trac.transmissionbt.com/wiki/Changes#version-2.12" class="postlink">release notes</a> for version 2.12?</div></blockquote><br />I have already explained this twice, in the descriptions to tickets #3688 and #3817. The former was written before you ever posted. I'll quote them here:<br /><br />3688 reads: &quot;we only support tracker <b style="color:black;background-color:#a0ffff">proxies</b>, not peer ones -- and few people have seemed to mind or even notice. If the lesson here is that few people use <b style="color:black;background-color:#a0ffff">proxies</b>, we should remove the feature as bloat. If the lesson here is that our proxy support isn't good enough, then we should still remove the feature and replace it with something better. Moreover, <span style="font-weight: bold">removing <b style="color:black;background-color:#a0ffff">proxies</b> and listening to the user feedback</span> will answer the question of which of these lessons is correct. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />&quot;<br /><br />3817 reads: &quot;I thought Transmission's proxy support was half-assed, and didn't think many people used it. <span style="font-weight: bold">The conclusion was to remove the feature to see if anyone noticed, as a way to measuring how important the feature was to users</span>, and whether peer-based support should be added.&quot;<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>ijuxda wrote:</cite>2. Why was a another ticket started (#3817) when the feedback in #3688 was clearly not in favor of the changes?</div></blockquote><br />The reasons for opening #3817 were described exactly where you would expect, in the description to #3817. To summarize: (1) as we all know now, it turned out that a small but vocal group felt strongly about proxy support, and (2) one insightful user asked if the Desktop's proxy settings would work instead. To me this sounded like an all-around win: <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Transmission</b> would get better desktop integration <span style="font-style: italic">and</span> people needing proxy support could use the Desktop's settings.<br /><br />Maybe I should have left 3817 in 3688 but that is a bookkeeping issue.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>ijuxda wrote:</cite>3. Why have the changes in #3817 been pushed through into the public svn repository (r11512, r11514, r11515, r11520) despite the ticket not being closed and agreement in the discussion not being reached?</div></blockquote><br />This is a three-parter:<br /><br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Regarding the commits themselves: r11512 was pushed when the libtransmission and GTK+ code was done; r11514 was pushed when the Qt code was done, and the other two commits were documentation improvements suggested by a user. This is pretty straightforward.</li><li>Regarding the ticket being open: livings hasn't finished the Mac client code yet, so the ticket is still open.</li><li>Regarding why I landed the code despite lack of agreement: as I've said, I thought the ticket was an all-around win. And I was right: most complaints stopped when users saw what Desktop Proxy Integration looked like. Also, where is it written that I can't commit code if you disagree with it? Who gave you signoff authority on <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Transmission</b>?</li></ol><br /><blockquote><div><cite>ijuxda wrote:</cite>4. Who is Jordan? If Jordan is an alias, why was this alias created?</div></blockquote><br />I changed my name on new year's for IRL personal reasons wholly unrelated to this issue. It is loosely related to <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Transmission</b>, but only in the sense that <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Transmission</b>, like many things, is part of my public life. I would have changed my name on new year's even if I had never heard of <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Transmission</b>. Perhaps if you were an IRL friend rather than someone slinging mud at me online I would tell you my private stories over a couple of beers.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>ijuxda wrote:</cite>If a public answer to any of these questions is not provided by a trustworthy representative of the <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">transmission</b> project, how can it be expected that users, contributors and third-pary onlookers will not express uncertainty and doubt about the direction and control of past, present and future development?</div></blockquote><br />Yep yep, scary scary bad men, booga booga. My answer:<br /><br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li> I <span style="font-style: italic">have</span> answered your questions... <span style="font-style: italic">again</span>.</li><li> Regarding &quot;trustworthy&quot;, users can look at Transmission's track record -- the two lead programmers have done <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Transmission</b> development in the public eye for 3+ years now. I've done open source programming on and off <span style="font-weight: bold">since October 1999</span>. We've had bugs and upset users, as is normal... but until now nobody has accused me of behaving in an untrustworthy way.</li><li> Users who have wireshark or LS can (and do) monitor <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Transmission</b> for themselves.</li><li> Users who understand code can read the program for themselves.</li><li> Users who <span style="font-style: italic">don't</span> understand code can note that you're champing at the bit to find some kind of nasty code <span style="font-style: italic">and</span> have been reviewing Transmission's code for nearly a month now <span style="font-style: italic">and</span> have nothing but smoke to blow.</li></ol><br /><blockquote><div><cite>ijuxda wrote:</cite>What prevents someone from speculating about the true causes of these occurences: &quot;Has the <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">transmission</b> project been compromised by legal action from more powerful entities, so much so that developers must remove features and make progressively more ludicrous attempts at covering up the influence?&quot;</div></blockquote><br />Again with the <a href="http://videosift.com/video/New-punctuation-mark-the-cavuto-daily-show-clip" class="postlink">Cavuto</a>.<br /><br />Nothing prevents someone from speculating about anything, of course. One only needs to turn on an AM radio to realize that. But I think your question is again based on a faulty premise:  First let's look at the question again: &quot;...so much so that developers must remove features...&quot; and then look at how <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Transmission</b> handles <b style="color:black;background-color:#a0ffff">proxies</b> in 2.20:<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><!-- ia0 --><b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">transmission</b>-using-the-desktop-proxy-settings.jpg<!-- ia0 --></div><br />It's <span style="font-style: italic">right there</span>! Proxy support is &quot;removed&quot; in the sense that we've farmed the work out to the Desktop. As a developer, I like that because (1) we now integrate better with the Desktop, (2) it removes a little bit of redundant code, and (3) now someone else is responsible for those bug reports <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> But are users going to look at that and complain? No.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I reiterate that the above is purely speculation and the result of the above enumerated questions remaining unanswered. It is representative though, of the private inquiries that I have received regarding this matter.</div></blockquote><br />They have been answered. In some cases, they have been answered three times.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I admit to everyone that what is happening here is a lot to process. I myself am unsure of the best way to proceed, but I will always endeavour to keep the best interests of all parties at heart. Slander notwithstanding, I do want <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">transmission</b> to be the best bittorrent client, and a fair and respected Free Software project.<br /><br />So please, if you care about this issue, make your opinion publicly known. Discuss it with others who you think would be interested or affected by the consequences. Until a satisfactory resolution is achieved do not be misled by tangential arguments, and do not forget the original premise of the debate.</div></blockquote><br />Well, <span style="font-style: italic">now</span> you tell me I shouldn't pay attention to tangental arguments!<br /><br />Your original premise was this:<br /><blockquote><div><cite>ijuxda wrote:</cite>The only reason I created an account here was to request that the tracker proxy support be restored. Please do not remove features without stating clearly in the release notes that you did so, and include your justifications. The only reason I can think of for removing this code would be due to a security vulnerability (in which case you should fix it) or that the functionality was superseded by something else (in which case you should mention how users of the previous version can achieve the same effect).</div></blockquote><br />So to answer all the questions in your &quot;original premise of this debate&quot;:<br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>I have already stated my justifications many times. I had already done so in the ticket where you wrote that comment.</li><li>The functionality has been superseded by #3817 (aka Desktop Proxy Integration) and it is obvious to anyone looking at that screenshot how to achieve the same effect.</li><li>As with your third question -- I'll paraphrase it as &quot;Why was Desktop Proxy Integration added to <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Transmission</b> when I said no?&quot; -- you seem to think the dev team has to follow your personal standards. I disagree.</li></ol><br />Responding to these ghost accusations is very time-consuming. In this post I have answered everything you've asked, even personal questions, even slippery accusations, even innuendo. If you still don't want to listen I don't know what more I can do.<br /><br />Lastly, I'd like to again give you due credit for putting sweat equity into the code over the past few weeks rather than only writing, as you call them, &quot;purposely provocative&quot; posts. I think that's a too-generous description, but people reading this thread should understand that you're also trying to walk the walk.</div>

You repeated that theme today in your hypothetical questions <a href="https://forum.transmissionbt.com/viewtopic.php?p=51593#p51593" class="postlink">here</a> and I have tried to answer all of them <a href="https://forum.transmissionbt.com/viewtopic.php?p=51595#p51595" class="postlink">here</a>.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>ijuxda wrote:</cite>Why not post the full message for the sake of an &quot;open, reasoned discussion&quot;?</div></blockquote><br />Because I deleted it.

			<div class="content">I am thankful for the effort put into the detailed and time-consuming replies here and on my github wiki; certainly my overreaching curiosity and unfounded suspicions have been satisfied, and there is enough material for anyone else interested in the discussion to form a clear idea of the situation.<br /><br />I make no demands or hold any expectations, but I would like to make a public personal conduct request to Jordan regarding any future disagreements with other people:<br /><br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Try to remain calm and polite even if you read part of something that upsets you. Take a moment to clear your head and realize you have enough time to form a reply to the best of your ability.</li><li>Don't feel you need to reply to every single thing being said; reflect on the argument as a whole and choose the most salient aspect for refutation. If that is not obvious, ask that it be expressed in a length and manner you find convenient. Cutting up an argument with too frequent interjections or cherry-picking small snippets from it might obscure the context and make misunderstandings more likely.</li><li>If you're going to cite logic and reasoning in your rebuttals take an extra moment to check that your own logic and reasoning is sound. (I don't know if Jon Stewart did segments on other logical fallacies, but there is a decent list on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy" class="postlink">wikipedia</a>.)</li><li>Be careful when interpreting implications, vagueness, sarcasm or the like. All statements are imprecise to some degree, so one person's assigned meaning will generally not match another's, nor may it match the author's intent.</li></ol>I know it's naive to assume that the lead programmer, server owner and forum administrator should be bound by anything I have to say, but I wanted to provide these suggestions in the interests of improving collaboration should a similar situation ever arise in the future.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>ijuxda wrote:</cite>I make no demands or hold any expectations, but I would like to make a public personal conduct request to Jordan regarding any future disagreements with other people:<br /><br />1. Try to remain calm and polite even if you read part of something that upsets you. Take a moment to clear your head and realize you have enough time to form a reply to the best of your ability.<br /><br />4. Be careful when interpreting implications, vagueness, sarcasm or the like. All statements are imprecise to some degree, so one person's assigned meaning will generally not match another's, nor may it match the author's intent.</div></blockquote><br />Gotcha. Just to be clear on these two related suggestions -- in the last month or so, you and norenore said all of the following things about me:<br /><br /><ul><li> that I don't &quot;trust [my] userbase enough to divulge the real reasons for why proxy support was removed&quot;</li><li> that I was likely to edit posts as &quot;a foolish attempt at revision of history&quot;</li><li> that deleting your &quot;purposefully provocative&quot; FUD was &quot;censorship&quot;</li><li> that I &quot;ignored&quot; the proxy issue for two months&quot; and gave &quot;no reasonable justifications for this change&quot;</li><li> that my &quot;logic is flawed, and that's being generous.&quot;</li><li> that my actions were &quot;incredibly stupid&quot;, &quot;ridiculous&quot;, &quot;pure amateur hour&quot;, and &quot;gung-ho, reactionary antics&quot;</li><li> that the Desktop Proxy Integration (as seen in the earlier screenshot) is &quot;obscure gnome internals&quot;, &quot;ill-conceived&quot;, and &quot;incredibly unintuitive&quot;</li><li> that I was &quot;disingenuous&quot;</li><li> &quot;speculating&quot; whether Transmission's been &quot;compromised by legal action&quot;</li><li> that I &quot;misled&quot; you by leaving #3817 open</li><li> that I have a &quot;fundamental lack of professionalism&quot;</li><li> that I gave you &quot;undeserved contempt&quot;</li><li> that I need to &quot;comes to [my] senses&quot;</li></ul><br />So you're saying that when I read all that crap, <span style="font-weight: bold">I</span> need to check <span style="font-weight: bold">myself</span> to be &quot;calm and polite.&quot;<br /><br />On top of that, it's probably my fault for misunderstanding all those statements because &quot;all statements are imprecise to some degree.&quot;<br /><br />Gotcha.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>ijuxda wrote:</cite>2. Don't feel you need to reply to every single thing being said; reflect on the argument as a whole and choose the most salient aspect for refutation. If that is not obvious, ask that it be expressed in a length and manner you find convenient. Cutting up an argument with too frequent interjections or cherry-picking small snippets from it might obscure the context and make misunderstandings more likely.</div></blockquote><br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>When I gave simple, concise explanations in the tickets, I got a month of crap from you. Now that I'm giving detailed explanations -- <span style="font-style: italic">as you requested</span> -- <span style="font-weight: bold">now</span> you're telling me to not answer everything.</li><li>Readers can see <a href="https://forum.transmissionbt.com/viewtopic.php?p=51572#p51572" class="postlink">here</a> and <a href="https://forum.transmissionbt.com/viewtopic.php?p=51595#p51595" class="postlink">here</a> that I've quoted you nearly in total to avoid losing context. I can't do that for the deleted post, but that's one data point out of many.</li><li>I find it confusing that you don't want me to respond to everything you've say, but also complain that I don't answer your points, and also you don't want me to cherry-pick pieces of what you've said.</li></ol><br /><blockquote><div><cite>ijuxda wrote:</cite>3. If you're going to cite logic and reasoning in your rebuttals take an extra moment to check that your own logic and reasoning is sound. (I don't know if Jon Stewart did segments on other logical fallacies, but there is a decent list on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy" class="postlink">wikipedia</a>.)</div></blockquote><br />I'm not going snipe hunting. Please specify where my logic was unsound so that I may correct it.</div>
